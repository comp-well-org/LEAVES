## 📍 Abstract

The repository "LEAVES" contains code for efficient tuning learning views for various self-superivsed learning methods using algorithms such as SimCLR and BYOL in time-series data. It includes functionality for data loading, model creation, training, and evaluation. The code provides implementations of ResNet encoders, auto-augmentation techniques, and linear evaluation models. It also includes custom distribution classes, such as "MixtureSameFamily" and "StableNormal", for working with reparameterized distributions in PyTorch.

| [train.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/train.py)     | The code provided contains several functions for training various models. The `trainSimCLR` and `trainSimCLR_` functions train a model using the SimCLR algorithm, optimizing both the encoder and the view maker. It computes the encoder and view maker loss and updates the respective optimizer.The `trainBYOL` and `trainBYOL_` functions train a model using the BYOL algorithm. Similar to SimCLR, it optimizes both the encoder and the view maker. It computes the encoder and view maker loss and updates the respective optimizer.The `trainLinearEvalution` function trains a model using linear evaluation. It optimizes only the encoder and uses a BCEWithLogitsLoss criterion. It trains the model on the given training data, computes the loss, and updates the optimizer.All functions save the model periodically, log the loss values, and print evaluation metrics (such as accuracy and confusion matrix) during training. |
| [main.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/main.py)       | The code above is a script that performs training and evaluation on a deep learning model. It imports various modules and functions from different files within the directory tree. The main function creates data loaders, creates a model, and trains or evaluates the model based on the configuration settings. The script supports different frameworks like SimCLR and BYOL. The create_model function creates the model and initializes it with pre-trained weights if specified. Finally, the main function calls the appropriate training or evaluation function based on the configuration settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [augmentation.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/utils/augmentation.py)               | The code in `augmentation.py` provides functions for data augmentation, specifically for time series data. The implemented functions include `jitter`, which adds random noise to the data, `scaling`, which scales the data by a random factor, `rotation`, which randomly rotates the features of the data, and `permutation`, which randomly splits the data into segments. These functions aim to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the robustness of machine learning models trained on the data.                                     |
| [data_utils.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/utils/data_utils.py)                   | The code in `utils/data_utils.py` provides functions for data preprocessing and conversion. It includes a function `normalize_data()` that normalizes a given dataset, `Catergorical2OneHotCoding()` which converts categorical data to one-hot encoding, `Logits2Binary()` which applies sigmoid function and returns the index of the maximum value, `logits_2_multi_label()` which converts logits to multi-label predictions, and `test()` which demonstrates the usage of these functions.                                                            |
| [dataset.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/utils/dataset.py)                         | The code defines several classes that extend the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class to handle different types of datasets. The datasets include `TransDataset`, `SleepEDFE_Dataset`, `SemiSupDatasetSMILE`, and `SupervisedDataset`. Each dataset class has its own `__init__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` methods to load, preprocess, and return the data. These datasets are designed for tasks such as data transformation, sleep electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning.               |
| [differentiable_augs.py](https://github.com/comp-well-org/LEAVES/blob/main/utils/differentiable_augs.py) | The code in `utils/differentiable_augs.py` provides functions for various data augmentation techniques. These include jittering, scaling, rotation, time distortion, permutation, magnitude warping, and frequency depression. These techniques can be used to augment data for tasks such as image classification or time series analysis. The code also includes custom autograd functions for differentiable rounding and converting tensors to floats. Overall, this code provides a set of functions for differentiable data augmentation operations. |
